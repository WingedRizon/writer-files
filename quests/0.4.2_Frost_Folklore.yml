        speech:
        - 'It all began long ago, when magic cursed our land. All people rightly feared this new source of might. So many of them declined it.'
        - 'But some found great joy and, with practice, learned to control it.'
        - 'The Frost Lords were one of the greater groups that used these supernatural powers, and oh they became so powerful.'
        - 'You know what makes them so special? They were able to create and duplicate artefacts. I see you are an aritifact bearer yourself.'
        - 'Wielding magic is especially dangerous in some cities... I needed to learn that lesson myself.'
        - 'Some day the Frost Lords were forced to leave their homeland. Their use of magic was seen as dangerous and unpredictable.'
        - 'However, they were not all united. Some of them, now the Frostfolk, feared the manipulation of magic into artefacts.'
        - 'Torn between their kin and their beliefs, the Frostfolk ended up exiled from Hilstead and left behind by the Frost Lords.'
        - 'They were lost, cold, and slowly starving to death.'
        - 'Their Leader Varaya led them to the riverbank, promising they would all survive...'
        - 'I want you to feel that bitterness, feel the hunger, and embrace the frozen nights.'
        - 'To understand what they felt, what they saw, I want you to bring me 10 Uncut Emeralds and 10 Elder Logs. Much like the Frostlords, half are ahead and half are behind.'
    goal-message: 'Listen to the story of the Lorekeeper.'

        - 'The Elder Logs stand for family, forever there, where they once were.'
        - 'The Frostfolk looked up into the stars, convinced that there was no turning back.'
        - 'Their family was always waiting, but stubbornness is as unwavering as the trees themselves.'
        - 'Using the wood nearby, they withstood the cold, warming themselves at the blazing fires of their new camp.'
        - 'There is only one thing missing to understand the life of the Frostfolk.'
        - 'Up here in the north there is not much variety in terms of food.'
        - 'The Frostfolk were good at fishing. They had to be. To survive. Out there...'
