  speech:
  - 'This place here was built by Togrund. A haven where we could practice magic in peace.'
  - 'Togrund, he''s always been headstrong, blunt even. Didn''t go well in Hilstead.'
  - 'Togrund fancied magic, you see, and the folk of Hilsted didn''t. So he left and took plenty of us with him.'
  - 'Why didn''t we join Wintervale? I asked him that same question. He called the people in Wintervale prejudiced snobs that only care about themselves.'
  - 'Things were peaceful here, though. We all did our part to make the best of our lives. Even on the darkest days, Togrund''s experiments never failed to excite!'
  - 'However, one day, I was coming back from a hunting trip... when I saw the smoke. Rushing back, I was too late... They had all turned undead.'
  - 'Please, find out what happened and set their souls at peace.'
