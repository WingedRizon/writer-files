  - 'If you had not come...I doubt we could have all made it out alive.'
  - 'I was foolish to speed up the training of these new recruits... My desperation to find our missing scouts mislead me and endangered their lives.'
  - 'Our scouts? Well a while ago we encountered a creature using fire... It was powerful like nothing I had ever seen before. It originated in The Firezone.'
  - 'About a week ago we sent a scouting party to investigate the zone. They were supposed to return within a few days...'
  - 'I do not know what happened to them, we can only assume the worst. Now I am training new recruits to set sail and rescue them.'
  - 'With your fighting skills, you could join us. However, it is clear that these trainees are not suited for battle yet.'
  - 'Firstly, they need new armour. Can you speak to the blacksmith about making it?'
