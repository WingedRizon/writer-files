  - 'So you''re the one Theia sent?'
  - 'I guess you can''t really choose your help these days.'
  - 'In any case, I appreciate you helping out. I hope I don''t need to explain the secrecy of the situation.'
  - 'Azana is not the place it used to be. Our leader is so fixated on expansion that he has ignored the troubles of his own people.'
  - 'We can''t even send troops to squash local bandits! I mean what kind of nation cannot keep peace within its own borders?'
  - 'I am sure you have seen the food shortages around here. A big reason for these are the bandits raiding our farms.'
  - 'Please speak to Farmer Lawson inside Silkwood Forest. He will tell you more.'
