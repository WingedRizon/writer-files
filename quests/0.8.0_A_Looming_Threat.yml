  - 'You must be %player%! Pleasure to meet you.'
  - 'What? You were not aware that us elves have psychic powers?'
  - 'I jest. I have spoken to Allaster in detail. He made me aware of your imminent arrival.'
  - 'I see. So that is why the Azanian dogs have been sniffing around Dead Man''s Rest. Their greed for power never ceases to amaze me.'
  - 'I do not know how you managed to snag the Ancient Tome from them, but I am very impressed that you did. It seems that Allaster was right.'
  - 'Unfortunately, that book contains archaic elven secrets. Sharing them with you would be contensious.'
  - 'However, if you can provide a service to the elves, I should be able to persuade the others that you are friend not foe.'
  - 'You might have seen some druids around the area. They possess memory fragments that are invaluable to our kind.'
  - 'By defeating them and recovering some of these fragments; you would gain immense favour.'
