  - 'Hello there, my name is Horak Mul. I work for the Sultanate of Zenyth. We’'re looking for recruits to join the colonies in the north.'
  - 'What does it entail? Well, the expedition is to the new colony of Zemmek in the northern desert archipelago. The land is ancient and unexplored... all there is is tribes of savage natives and legends of untold wealth.'
  - 'Some believe the land to be cursed... they are, of course, wrong. The seemingly endless, sun blessed dunes are also known as The Sun''s Reach, or Bek'’s Loss. But, err, we prefer not to talk about that. '
  - 'Do you want to join?... You do? Excellent!'
  - 'Just hop aboard the ship.'

        - 'Anyways, for the fires the next few nights, we'’ll need just a little bit of wood. Twenty Palm Logs should be more than sufficient.'

        - 'To disrespectful outsiders, they do not give them the privilege of knowing this lands true name. For a desecrator, it is a grievous insult to say the Island’’s name.'
