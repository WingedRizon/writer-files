        speech:
        - 'Halt! I hear it! The faint hum of true steel, the natural bowing of our own local flora.'
        - 'And most of all, the aura of excellence. You wield one of our sacred tools. I feel it, the Koldorian Pickaxe.'
        - 'One who appreciates our ancient craft is a friend of mine! What brings you to my forge?'
        - 'Magic? Ah, yes, I see the rune burned into your arm.'
        - 'However, I am afraid the most I can do is point you to Hilstead, the village of the vikings.'
        - 'Their knowledge of magic far exceeds my own. You shall find your answers there.'
        - 'But beware, this knowledge has caused them to resent users of the craft.'
        - 'To ease potential tension, first travel north to Whaletown.'
        - 'There you must enter their tournament of strength. Winning it should curry enough favour to seek audience with their chief.'
        - 'Safe travels, adventurer. If you are ever passing through our lands again; may we share a toast.'
